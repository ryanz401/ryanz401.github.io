<p1>Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies will have powerful impacts on learning not only through direct supports for students, but also by empowering educators to be more adaptive to learner needs and less consumed by routine, repetitive tasks. There is little question that we need innovative approaches in education and that AI will be a major new capability that allows innovation. Simply put, we will be able to do things that we have never done before! </p1>
